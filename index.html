        <p><em>
            "Tapasya is a very patient and caring yoga teacher. She always has a plan for each day and tries to change her yoga routine to break the boredom! I’m always curious to see what she has planned for each session!
            She has been my son’s yoga teacher as well for the past year and he loves being part of her sessions.
            I started my yoga journey with Tapasya a year ago and I’m so happy with her teaching style."
            <br>- Vidya Natarajan</p>
        <p>"My 9 year and 13 year old have been learning Yoga from Tapasya for over a year now. I love how she guides them through the different yoga poses in a calm way while also explaining the health benefits. She also incorporates breathing
          exercises to calm them down and help with focusing."
